> Tracking the Path to getting IPFS and other Decentralized Protocols Natively Supported in Web Browsers.

## Current Status

[![Waffle.io - Columns and their card count](https://badge.waffle.io/ipfs/in-web-browsers.svg?columns=all)](https://waffle.io/ipfs/in-web-browsers)

Currently in order to run IPFS in a web browser, you have to either bundle js-ipfs with your client-side application or your users have to run a go-ipfs daemon on their local machines. This means we've completed the first step on [The Path to Native Browser Support](#Roadmap).

You can now install the [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion), a Web Extension that works in Chrome, Firefox and Brave to give your browser super powers, I mean, to add support for the IPFS protocol.

**Watch @lidel give a quick update on the IPFS Companion at the IPFS All Hands Dec 12:**
