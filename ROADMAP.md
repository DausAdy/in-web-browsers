# Roadmap for IPFS in Web Browsers

> This page provides the community with a high level overview of our current priorities and ongoing endevours.

# Roadmap

### Prerequisites
- *DONE:* Implement [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and [js-ipfs-api](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api)
- *DONE:* Create browser extension ([ipfs-companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion)) that detects IPFS resources and redirects requests to local gateway.

### Long Game
- *IN PROGRESS:* Make [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) interoperate seamlessly
- *IN PROGRESS:* Improve extension so it handles distributed protocols natively without need for third party software.
- *IN PROGRESS:* Define the APIs, address schemes, security models, etc.
- *IN PROGRESS:* Make the case for IPFS & Decentralized Web Protocols in Web Browsers with Use Cases, Sample Applications, Demos and Delightful Documentation
- *IN PROGRESS:* Work with browser vendors on adding missing APIs and solving discovered problems.

### Goals
- **Native support in the Browsers:** protocol handlers for decentralized web protocols, especially IPFS and IPLD, bundled natively in web browsers.
- **Dapps are just.. apps:** creating web applications with IPFS is a viable alternative to HTTP-based stack.


# Appendix: Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We do our best to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

Current and past OKRs can be found at: https://github.com/ipfs/pm/blob/master/OKR/WB.md
